# Cors

CORS stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing. In a nutshell, as a security measure, browsers aren't allowed to access resources outside their own domain.

```ts title="server.ts"
const { middleware, resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  ctx: createContext,
  cors: {
    origin: 'http://localhost:4000',
    credentials: true,
    allowedHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header'],
    methods: ['POST'],
    maxAge: 300,
    exposedHeaders: ['Content-Type'],
  },
});
```
