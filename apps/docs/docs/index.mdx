# Introduction

Welcome to ptsq!

Public type-safe query is library for creating type-safe API with TS backend and any language client.

It offers introspection of API schema and allow you to easily create type-safe queries, mutations, middlewares and so on.

## Motivation

The motivation is that (tRPC)[https://trpc.io/] allows you to create easily type-safe backend but does not offer some kind of introspectoin, so it cannot be used for type-safe open API.
On the other hand (GraphQL)[https://graphql.org/] offers the schema introspection for type-safe open API, but setting up the project and writing graphql resolvers is much more harder.

This library combining the best from those two worlds.

## Requirements

You have to enable `strictNullChecks` or use `strict` mode which includes `strictNullChecks`. Otherwise Zod cannot correctly infer the types of your schemas.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  //...
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true // <- must be true
    //...
  }
  //...
}
```
