# Validations

Arguments and output validation are one of the concepts of `ptsq`.

For the validation, the library uses [Typebox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox).

## Why not Zod?

The reason is that Typebox creates JSON schemas for validation, so the introspection is then very easy to do.

In Zod, the library has to convert the Zod schema into JSON schema for introspection.

From Typebox, `ptsq` can infer the Typescript type.
