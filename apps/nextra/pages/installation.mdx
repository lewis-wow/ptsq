# Installation

The library offers several modules that can be installed separately, which means that if you don't need the server part of the web application to create the client part, you only need to install the client module.

For creating an application server.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ptsq/server
```

For creating a client.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ptsq/client
```

The CLI tool for introspecting remote PTSQ schema.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --dev @ptsq/introspection-clie
```
