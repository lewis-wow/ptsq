# PTSQ server

The `ptsq` function creates an instance of the PTSQ server.
However, it does not create the server components themselves, it creates a builder that offers the ability to add middleware to the entire server in addition to creating components.

PTSQ itself does not offer any option to create an HTTP server.
Like GraphQL or tRPC, PTSQ uses only a single HTTP endpoint.
The library provides listeners for HTTP servers created by external modules such as [node:http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/), or [Koa](https://koajs.com/), for serverless or alternative environments, such as [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [Deno](https://deno.com/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and for full-stack frameworks, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

```ts copy filename="Creating a PTSQ server"
import { ptsq } from '@ptsq/server';

const { resolver, router serve, ptsqEndpoint } = ptsq().create();
```

You can directly export all created components for further use.

```ts copy filename="Creating a PTSQ server"
import { ptsq } from '@ptsq/server';

export const { resolver, router serve, ptsqEndpoint } = ptsq().create();
```

## Server options

### Context and CORS

Both [context](/server/context) and [CORS](/server/cors) are described in other chapters.

### Endpoint

The `endpoint` setting specifies the path on which the PTSQ server will listen for requests.
The default is `/ptsq`, which means that the server will listen on the HTTP endpoint `/ptsq`, for example `http://localhost:3000/ptsq`.

If the PTSQ server is deployed inside a REST API endpoint, for example `/api`, the `endpoint` setting must respect this and so its value must be set to `/api/ptsq`.
This is especially necessary when using PTSQ with a full-stack framework such as Next.js or SvelteKit, where the application can be deployed in the file-system routers provided by these frameworks.
With this setting, trailing slashes are automatically removed, so it doesn't matter whether the value is set as `/api/ptsq` or `api/ptsq`.

```ts copy filename="Endpoint setting"
ptsq({
  //...,
  endpoint: 'api/ptsq',
});

ptsq({
  //...,
  endpoint: '/api/ptsq',
});
```

### fetchAPI

The fetchAPI option is for defining which API you will use for the request and response.

```ts copy filename="fetchAPI setting"
import type { Request, Response } from 'framework';

ptsq({
  //...,
  fetchAPI: {
    Request: Request,
    Response: Response,
  },
});
```

It's very useful if you are using some integration that has its own request or response object.
