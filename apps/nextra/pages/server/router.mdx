# Router

Routers serve as blueprints for defining the API interface, offering a structured way to organize and manage endpoints. One notable feature of this model is the ability to nest routers within a single `Base` router, providing a hierarchical structure that reflects the logical organization of your API.

Moreover, routers can be merged seamlessly across files, allowing you to define routers independently and then consolidate them into a unified `Base` router. This modular approach enhances code organization and maintainability, facilitating better scalability and extensibility of your API.

Exporting the `type` of the `Base` router is recommended as it enables clients, particularly in a monorepo project structure, to specify the server as a `devDependency`. This promotes better dependency management and version control, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different parts of your project.

```ts copy
import { ptsq } from '@ptsq/server';
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { userRouter } from './userRouter';

const app = express();

const createContext = ({ req, res }: { req: Request; res: Response }) => ({
  req,
  res,
});

const { resolver, router, serve } = ptsq({
  ctx: createContext,
}).create();

// routers can be merged as you want
const baseRouter = router({
  a: router({
    b: router({
      c: router({
        user: userRouter,
      }),
    }),
  }),
});

export type BaseRouter = typeof baseRouter;

app.use((req, res) => serve(baseRouter)(req, res));

app.listen(4000);
```

## Client

On the client side routers are objects (Proxy objects).
If routers are nested on the server, it creates the nesting on the client side as well.

```ts copy
import { createProxyClient } from '@ptsq/client';
import { BaseRouter } from './server';

const client = createProxyClient<BaseRouter>({
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/ptsq'
});

const result = await client.a.b.c.user.current.query();

// auto-completion
const userList = await client.a. /* b.c.user.userList.query() */
```

## Type-level only

The `BaseRouter` is a Typescript type, which means the client doesn't know anything about the server in runtime.

```ts
//@ts-ignore
const result = await client.a.wrong.route.query();
```

That means you can disable the type hinting and call the wrong route.
If the wrong route is called, then the server responds with `BAD_REQUEST` error.
