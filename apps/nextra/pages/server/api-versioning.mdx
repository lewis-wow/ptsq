# API versioning

You have the flexibility to version your API just like you would with a traditional REST API.

<Video src="/assets/api-versioning.mp4" />

```ts copy filename="server.ts"
import { baseRouterV1 } from 'baseRouterV1';
import { baseRouterV2 } from 'baseRouterV2';

export const baseRouter = router({
  v1: baseRouterV1,
  v2: baseRouterV2,
});
```

Subsequently, you can retrieve your API version within the client by accessing it as part of the route.

```ts copy filename="client.ts"
const client = createProxyClient<BaseRouter>({
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/ptsq',
});

client /* v1 | v2 */.v1.user
  .query();

client /* v1 | v2 */.v2.user
  .query();
```
