# Server middleware

Sometimes the middleware of the resolver is not enough.
It is only started if the path to the endpoint that the resolver creates is successfully found.
If the path is not found or some other error occurs before the PTSQ endpoint is selected, the middleware does not start.
Because of this situation, server middleware support exists.
These are created when the PTSQ server instance is created and run on each request before the router is called to navigate the request within the API.

The server middleware can modify or format inputs and outputs, both error and success.
Format error outputs on the production environment, or conversely, in the development environment, output all error outputs to the console.
It also allows you to create logging, either simple console logging or using some external service.

```ts copy
const { resolver, router, serve } = ptsq(...).use(async ({ next }) => {
  const response = await next();

  if(
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' &&
    !response.ok
  ) {
    console.error(response.error);
  }

  return response;
}).create();
```
