# Query

In PTSQ, queries are handled via POST requests due to the potential complexity of the data being sent from the client to the server.

When a query is requested from the client, the associated resolve function is called, receiving `{ input, ctx }` parameters. Here, input represents the actual input for the query, while ctx represents the context, which may vary depending on whether the resolver creating the query employs middleware.

Input validation is conducted by the input schema, ensuring that the provided data meets specified criteria. Similarly, the output of the resolver, returned from the resolve function, undergoes validation by the output schema.

If input validation fails, the PtsqError throws a BAD_REQUEST error, providing details about the validation error within the info property as a Typebox validation schema error result.

Likewise, if output validation fails, the PtsqError throws an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR error, including information about the validation error within the info property.

These error-handling mechanisms ensure robust data validation and integrity throughout the query process, enhancing the reliability and consistency of data exchanges between the client and server.

```ts copy filename="query.ts"
import { ptsq, Type } from '@ptsq/server';
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';

const app = express();

const createContext = ({ req, res }: { req: Request; res: Response }) => ({
  req,
  res,
});

const { resolver, router, serve } = ptsq({
  ctx: createContext,
}).create();

const testQuery = resolver
  .args(Type.Object({ name: Type.String() }))
  .output(Type.String())
  .query(({ input /* { name: string } */ }) /* string */ => {
    return `Hello, ${input.name}`;
  });

const baseRouter = router({
  test: testQuery,
});

export type BaseRouter = typeof baseRouter;

app.use((req, res) => serve(baseRouter)(req, res));

app.listen(4000);
```
