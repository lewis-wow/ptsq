# Resolver chaining

Using resolvers, middleware can be chained inside an application, similar to validation schemes for arguments or outputs.
This allows you to create complex downstream logic and prepare multiple components in the form of resolvers that can be used in multiple places.
Chaining middleware comes in handy when dealing with user authorization and permission checking.
When creating individual resolvers covering different permissions, chaining allows you to build on the already resolved logic of another resolver.

In the code sample, a resolver is created that decides whether a user is logged in.
This creates a single reusable block or component that can be used in multiple places within the application.
If the user querying any endpoint created by this resolver is not logged in, the server returns an error response.

```ts copy filename="Logged-in resolver"
const loggedInResolver = resolver.use(({ ctx, next }) => {
  if(ctx.user === undefined) throw new PtsqError({ code: 'UNAUTHORIZED' });

  return next({
    ctx: {
      user: ctx.user
    }
  });
});

// using a resolver that only allows communication to logged in users
loggedInResolver.output(...).query(...);
```

If the endpoint in the application were only allowed to a specific user role, logically the user must be logged in at the same time.
By using the previous resolver, we create a new one that effectively uses the restrictions defined in the previous resolver and adds another one of its own.
This way of building on previous already defined components supports a very efficient way of creating authorization.
Complex methods such as ACL or voter can also be used for the authorization itself.

```ts copy filename="Admin resolver"
const adminResolver = loggedInResolver.use(({ ctx, next }) => {
  if(ctx.user.role !== Role.Admin) throw new PtsqError({ code: 'FORBIDDEN' });

  return next({
    ctx: {
      user: ctx.user
    }
  });
});

// using a resolver that allows communication only for users with the administrator role
adminResolver.output(...).query(...);
```

By leveraging predefined resolvers with middleware, we simply create type-safe and reusable server components that can be used and extended at different points in the application.
These components carry with them the logic they resolve, thanks to the defined middleware.
With the ability to define separate middleware and unify resolvers, the functionality can then be attached to any other resolver.
This means that even a resolver that only allows communication for users with the administrator role can provide logging.

```ts copy filename="Resolver chaining"
import { adminResolver, envelopedResolver } from './resolvers';

const adminEnvelopedResolver = envelopedResolver.pipe(adminResolver);

adminEnvelopedResolver.output(...).query(...);
```
