# Standalone resolver

The library allows you to create a standalone resolver independent of the PTSQ server instance.
Using the `Resolver.createRoot` static method, you can create an external resolver without creating a server and define the type of context that this resolver requires.
By creating an independent resolver, the library supports the creation of standalone components that can be easily connected to a server.
An independent resolver can, like a classic resolver, create PTSQ endpoints and thus can be attached to any PTSQ instance.
The resolver unification described below can also be used to connect to an application.
When connecting created endpoints or resolvers, the application context type just needs to extend the defined context type of the standalone resolver, so the application context can contain multiple properties.
If this restriction does not apply, TypeScript will not allow a resolver to be attached to the application at the type level.

```ts copy filename="Standalone resolver with context requiremens"
const standaloneResolver = Resolver.createRoot<{ user?: User }>();
```
