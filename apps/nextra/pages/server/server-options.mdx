# Server options

There are a few `createServer` options and this chapter describes them.

## Context and CORS

Both [context](/context) and [CORS](/cors) are described in other chapters.

## Root

Root and endpoint server options are for serving the `ptsq` application in the right endpoint.

If you are using for example Next.js, typically you have your API in the `/api` directory in pages.

You have to mount `ptsq` application by using the `root` option, so the server knows its root path.

```ts
const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  //...,
  root: '/api',
});
```

## Endpoint

If you want to customize the `ptsq` path, you can use the endpoint option.

```ts
const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  //...,
  endpoint: '/my-ptsq-server',
});
```

You can also use the combination of root and endpoint options of course.

```ts
const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  //...,
  root: '/api',
  endpoint: '/my-ptsq-server',
});
```

All trailing slashes are removed, so you don't have to care about them.

```ts
const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  //...,
  root: '/api/',
  endpoint: '/my-ptsq-server/',
});
```

## fetchAPI

The fetchAPI option is for defining which API you will use for the request and response.

```ts
const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  //...,
  fetchAPI: {
    Request: Request,
    Response: Response,
  },
});
```

It's very useful if you are using some integration that has its own request or response object.

### Sveltekit example

```ts
const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  //...,

  // now ptsq knows, that you are using those fetch request and response objects
  fetchAPI: globalThis,
});
```
