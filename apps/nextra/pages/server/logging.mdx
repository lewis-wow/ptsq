# Logging

Logging queries and possibly successful or failed responses is one of the key features of the server.
Logging makes it possible to detect errors in different environments such as stage or production.
Logging is enabled inside the PTSQ application by creating logging middleware, which can be deployed as server middleware or inside the resolver.

```ts copy
ptsq(...).use(async ({ meta, next, ctx }) => {
  const response = await next();

  ctx.logger.logAction({
    route: meta.route,
    payload: {
      meta,
      response
    }
  });

  return response;
});
```
