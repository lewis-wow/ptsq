# Resolver

One of the three components of the PTSQ server is the resolver, which is responsible for creating queries and mutations.
It allows you to add validation schemes for arguments and outputs.
The resolver acts as a builder that forms the final PTSQ endpoint.
This can be of type `query` or `mutation`, depending on the purpose.
The query endpoint should not modify data and should be safe and idempotent.
Conversely, mutations should change data and need not be idempotent.
These types of endpoints are also used on the client side for query caching and invalidation purposes.

## Arguments

The `Resolver.args` method allows to add arguments to the resolver.
When the method is used, a new resolver with a validation scheme is created, and the original resolver remains unchanged.
This makes the operation of adding arguments immutable, primarily because of the need to register data types.
These do not support any overwriting capability, so a new data type must always be created.
Arguments are specified using JSON validation schemas, created using the Typebox builder, which allows you to derive TypeScript types from these schemas.
This ensures that type-safe arguments are added via type inference while ensuring the safety of arguments at runtime via verification and validation based on JSON schemas.
The `Resolver.args` method can be called repeatedly to chain arguments.
Chaining can occur anywhere in the endpoint creation process.
Chained validation schemes are linked using JSON `allOf` construct.

```ts filename="Resolver with arguments" copy
const resolverWithFirstName = resolver.args(
  Type.Object({
    firstName: Type.String(),
  }),
);
```

## Arguments chaining

The advantage of chaining is the ability to replace a resolver with another, already prepared one at any time in the chain, thus creating reusable components.

```ts filename="Arguments chaining" copy
resolverWithFirstName.args(
  Type.Object({
    lastName: Type.String(),
  }),
);
```

```ts filename="Arguments chaining" copy
resolver
  .args(
    Type.Object({
      firstName: Type.String(),
    }),
  )
  .args(
    Type.Object({
      lastName: Type.String(),
    }),
  );
```

Arguments can be chained until the resolver produces either a query or a mutation.
The created endpoint will then access a `input` object that is type-safe and its type exactly matches the data validated by the input validation JSON schema.
This way, the developer never loses track of the expected endpoint input, minimizing errors and inefficiencies.
Should the input validation (arguments) be evaluated as invalid at runtime, the server will automatically return a HTTP response 400, Bad request with the PTSQ error code [PTSQ_VALIDATION_FAILED](/server/errors#error-codes).

## Output schemas

In addition to adding arguments, the resolver also has the ability to add outputs.
Like adding arguments, adding outputs is an immutable operation, which means that the original resolver remains unchanged and a new resolver is created with the added output validation scheme.
The output validation scheme not only checks the return value type of the function (handler) that represents the query or mutation, but also performs runtime validation of the output.
If the output is not valid, the server will return an HTTP response of 500, Internal Server Error, with a PTSQ error code of [INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR](/server/errors#error-codes).

```ts filename="Resolver with output" copy
resolver.args(...).output(
  Type.Object({
    firstName: Type.String(),
  }),
);
```

In the case of an invalid input or output, the error response data automatically includes information about the validation itself to justify why the input or output is invalid.

## Dual validation

Because TypeScript is used on both the server and client side, PTSQ provides the ability to share validation schemes between the frontend and backend.
The use of dual validation brings a huge advantage in optimizing network communication with the server.
On the frontend, the same validation scheme is used to validate the form.
If the form is not valid, there is no need to burden the server by sending invalid data.
Only if the form is valid is the data sent to the server.
However, the server must also re-validate the data for security reasons.

```ts filename="External shared schemas" copy
import { BookSchema, createBookSchema } from './validations';

resolver.args(createBookSchema).output(BookSchema);
```

```ts filename="External shared schemas - React hook form" copy
import type { Static } from '@ptsq/server';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { createBookSchema } from './validations';

useForm<Static<typeof createBookSchema>>({
  resolver: typeboxResolver(createBookSchema),
  defaultValues: {
    published: false,
  },
});
```
