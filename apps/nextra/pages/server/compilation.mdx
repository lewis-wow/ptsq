# Compilation

Every argument or output schemas are compiled by TypeBox TypeCompiler.

The reason for the compilation is to create very high-performance validations.

The TypeBox TypeCompiler is a high-performance JIT validation compiler that transforms TypeBox types into optimized JavaScript validation routines.

## Cold starts

The compilation is done in runtime, so the first call of validation can be slightly slower than the others because of the compilation step.

```txt
parsing: 0.706ms
parsing: 0.018ms
parsing: 0.042ms
```

These stats are from the real application. As you can see, the first parsing process lasts longer than others.

## Compilers sharing

You can share your compilers across the whole application, so the same validation schema would not be compiled twice.

```ts copy filename="compiler.ts"
import { Compiler } from '@ptsq/server';

export const compiler = new Compiler();
```

```ts copy filename="external-resolver.ts"
import { Resolver } from '@ptsq/server';
import { compiler } from './compiler';

const externalResolver = Resolver.createRoot({
  compiler: compiler,
});
```

```ts copy filename="main.ts"
import { createServer } from '@ptsq/server';
import { compiler } from './compiler';
import { externalResolver } from './external-resolver';

const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  ctx: () => ({}),
  compiler: compiler,
});

// ...
```

## Typebox vs Zod

Performance comparison between Typebox and Zod validations.

```ts copy filename="validation.ts"
const personSchemaTypeBox = Type.Intersect([
  Type.Object({
    firstName: Type.String({ minLength: 4 }),
    age: Type.Number({ minimum: 18 }),
  }),
  Type.Object({
    lastName: Type.Optional(Type.String({ minLength: 4 })),
  }),
]);

const personSchemaZod = z.intersection(
  z.object({
    firstName: z.string().min(4),
    age: z.number().min(18),
  }),
  z.object({
    lastName: z.string().min(4).optional(),
  }),
);
```

### Test 1

```ts copy
const data = {
  firstName: 'John',
  age: 22,
};
```

```txt
non-compiled Typebox schema check: 0.247ms
Typebox compilation: 0.738ms
compiled Typebox schema check: 0.024ms
Zod schema check: 0.67ms
```

### Test 2

```ts copy
const data = {
  firstName: 'John',
  age: 22,
  lastName: 'Doe', // invalid!
};
```

```txt
non-compiled Typebox schema check: 0.244ms
Typebox compilation: 0.702ms
compiled Typebox schema check: 0.025ms
Zod schema check: 0.846ms
```

### Results

As you can see from those small tests, the Typebox compilation step is almost as fast as the Zod validation.

But the compilation runs only once per whole application deployment, every next validation is cached and validated by a compiled JavaScript function.

It's not complicated schemas, but the tests shows the most used pattern which is intersection of two schemas in `ptsq`
