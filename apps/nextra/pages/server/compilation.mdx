# Compilation

Every argument or output schemas are compiled by TypeBox TypeCompiler.

The reason for the compilation is to create very high-performance validations.

The TypeBox TypeCompiler is a high-performance JIT validation compiler that transforms TypeBox types into optimized JavaScript validation routines.

## Cold starts

The compilation is done in runtime, so the first call of validation can be slightly slower than the others because of the compilation step.

```txt
parsing: 0.706ms
parsing: 0.018ms
parsing: 0.042ms
```

These stats are from the real application. As you can see, the first parsing process lasts longer than others.
