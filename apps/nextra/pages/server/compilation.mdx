# Compilation

Each argument or output schema is compiled by the [TypeBox TypeCompiler](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox?tab=readme-ov-file#typecheck-typecompiler) right before the validation process.

Compilation is conducted to facilitate highly efficient validations.

## Lazy compilation

Since compilation occurs at runtime, the initial validation call may experience a slight delay compared to subsequent ones due to the compilation step.
This delay is a natural part of the process and typically minimally impacts overall performance once the initial compilation is complete.

## Compilation cache

By default, compiled schemas are not cached at all.

There is a module `@ptsq/cached-json-schema-parser` that caches every compiled validation schema by schema instance.

```ts copy
import { createCachedJsonSchemaParser } from '@ptsq/cached-json-schema-parser';

const { parser } = createCachedJsonSchemaParser();

const { resolver, router, serve } = ptsq({
  parser,
}).create();
```
