# Description

You can add a description to a resolver, and then on the client side, the TypeScript shows that description in the client query and mutation types.

Description works the same with or without introspection.

```ts
resolver.description('Returns user from database by user id');
```

The description can be overwritten by calling the `description` method again.

```ts
resolver.description('A').description('B'); // B
```
