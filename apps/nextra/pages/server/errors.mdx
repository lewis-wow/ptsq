# Errors

```ts copy
const isAuthedResolver = resolver.use(({ ctx, next }) => {
  if (!ctx.user)
    throw new PtsqError({
      code: 'UNAUTHORIZED',
      message: 'Must be logged in!',
    });

  return next({
    ctx: {
      user: ctx.user,
    },
  });
});
```

The `PtsqError` is the only error that is caught by the `ptsq`.
The adapter such as `Express` or `Koa` then responds with that error code and message, if specified.
You can also specify cause, which can be something like a schema validation error.

```ts copy
throw new PtsqError({
  code: 'BAD_REQUEST',
  message: 'User already exists.',
  cause: databaseInsert.error,
});
```

## Built in error codes

| Code                  | Description                                                                                                             | HTTP code |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| BAD_REQUEST           | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error.              | 400       |
| PARSE_FAILED          | The server cannot parse the request body.                                                                               | 400       |
| VALIDATION_FAILED     | The arguments schema validation failed.                                                                                 | 400       |
| BAD_ROUTE_TYPE        | The route is query and should be mutation and vice versa.                                                               | 400       |
| UNAUTHORIZED          | The client request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource. | 401       |
| FORBIDDEN             | The server was unauthorized to access a required data source, such as a REST API.                                       | 403       |
| NOT_FOUND             | The server cannot find the requested resource.                                                                          | 404       |
| INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR | An unspecified error occurred.                                                                                          | 500       |

## Custom error code

The `httpStatus` code is not required, if not specified the status will be 500 as if `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.

```ts copy
throw new PtsqError({
  code: {
    ptsqCode: 'USER_ALREADY_EXISTS',
    httpStatus: 400,
  },
  message: 'User already exists.',
  cause: databaseInsert.error,
});
```

```ts copy filename="errors/userAlreadyExists.ts"
export const USER_ALREADY_EXISTS: PtsqCustomErrorCode = {
  ptsqCode: 'USER_ALREADY_EXISTS',
  httpStatus: 400,
};
```

```ts copy
throw new PtsqError({
  code: USER_ALREADY_EXISTS,
  message: 'User already exists.',
  cause: databaseInsert.error,
});
```
