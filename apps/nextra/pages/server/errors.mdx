# Errors

```ts copy filename="error-in-middleware.ts"
const isAuthedResolver = resolver.use(({ ctx, next }) => {
  if (!ctx.user)
    throw new PtsqError({
      code: 'UNAUTHORIZED',
      message: 'Must be logged in!',
    });

  return next({
    ctx: {
      user: ctx.user,
    },
  });
});
```

The `PtsqError` is the only error that is caught by the PTSQ.
The adapter such as `Express` or `Koa` then responds with that error code and message, if specified.
You can also specify cause, which can be something like a schema validation error.

```ts copy
throw new PtsqError({
  code: 'BAD_REQUEST',
  message: 'User already exists.',
  cause: databaseInsert.error,
});
```
