# Context

Context holds some information across all resolvers, queries, mutations and middlewares.

The only way to customize context in the runtime is middleware.

```ts copy
const createContext = ({ req, res }: { req: Request; res: Response }) => {
  return {
    req,
    res,
  };
};

const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  ctx: createContext,
});
```

Context types like context input and output are automatically inferred, so you don't have to care about them.

The only argument that context gets is the adapter request and response information.

## Async context

The context builder function can be async as well, so you can for example wait for database request or wait for JWT token decode.

```ts copy
const createContext = async ({ req, res }: { req: Request; res: Response }) => {
  const user = await JWT.decode(req.cookies.jwt);

  return {
    req,
    res,
    user,
  };
};

const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  ctx: createContext,
});
```

## Global variables

In context, there should be also the global variables that you want to have available in every query, mutation or middleware.

A typical global variable in the context can be a database connection.

```ts copy
import { prisma } from './prisma';

const createContext = ({ req, res }: { req: Request; res: Response }) => {
  return {
    req,
    res,
    prisma,
  };
};

const { resolver, router, serve } = createServer({
  ctx: createContext,
});
```

In the example, there is a `Prisma` ORM database connection that is passed into the context, so you can then access the Prisma connection anywhere in the routes.

## Middlewares

You can also mutate the context. The only place where you can do that is middleware.

```ts copy
const resolverWithNewPropInCtx = resolver.use(({ ctx, next }) => {
  return next({
    ...ctx,
    newProperty: 'my-new-property',
  });
});
```

If I use the `resolverWithNewPropInCtx` there will be `newProperty` in the context. The `newProperty` will be also in the type level as well.

### Middleware checks

Typically you want to use middleware for authentication.

```ts copy
const authedResolver = resolver.use(({ ctx /* User | undefined */, next }) => {
  if (!ctx.user) throw new PtsqError({ code: 'UNAUTHORIZED' });

  return next({
    ...ctx, // { user: User | undefined }
    user: ctx.user, // User - because of the check before
  }); // { user: User }
});
```

The type of the `authedResolver` context will be inferred as in the example before.

The most important piece of code is this

```ts
return next({
  ...ctx,
  user: ctx.user,
});
```

Thanks to returning the next function and passing the new context, the type can be inferred in the next resolver.

```ts
user: ctx.user;
```

This is too very important, cause we checked that the user cannot be falsy in the example, this assignment correctly set the types for the next context user property.

## Mutation and query

You can access the context in the mutations and queries.

```ts
authedResolver
  .output(Type.String())
  .query(({ ctx /* user: User */ }) => ctx.user.name);
```

```ts copy
authedResolver
  .output(PostSchema)
  .mutation(async ({ ctx /* user: User, prisma: PrismaClient */ }) => {
    const post = await ctx.prisma.post.create({
      data: {
        user: ctx.user.id,
        // ...
      },
    });

    return post;
  });
```
