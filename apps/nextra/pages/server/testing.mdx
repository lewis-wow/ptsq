# Testing

You can test your ptsq application by creating a server side caller.

```ts copy filename="server.test.ts"
const testBaseRouter = baseRouter.createServerSideCaller({
  /* ctx */,
  req: {} as any,
  res: {} as any,
  user: new User({ admin: true }) // fake or seeded user for testing
});

/**
 * Access queries and mutations as with the client but without any server creation and http calls
 */
const response /* string */ = await testBaseRouter.greetings.query({
  /* type-safe as client */
  name: /* string */ 'John'
});
```
