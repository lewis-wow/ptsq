# Middlewares

The Middleware function runs before every route call (query, mutation) that the resolver that uses the middleware creates.
The `next` function determines when the next middleware will start.

```ts copy
import { PtsqServer } from '@ptsq/server';
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { getUserFromJWT } from './getUserFromJWT';
import { userRouter } from './userRouter';

const app = express();

const createContext = async ({ req, res }: { req: Request; res: Response }) => {
  const user = await getUserFromJWT(req.cookies.jwt);

  return {
    req,
    res,
    user,
  };
};

const { resolver, router } = PtsqServer.init({
  ctx: createContext,
}).create();

const protectedResolver = resolver.use(({ ctx, next }) => {
  if (!ctx.user) throw new Error('Must be logged in!');

  return next({
    ...ctx,
    user: ctx.user,
  });
});

resolver.query({
  resolve: async ({
    ctx /* { user: User | null } */,
    input /* undefined */,
  }) => {
    return `Hello, ${ctx.user.name}`;
    // throws Error user can be null
  },
});

protectedResolver.query({
  resolve: async ({ ctx /* { user: User } */, input /* undefined */ }) => {
    return `Hello, ${ctx.user.name}`;
  },
});
```

The `next` function only returns the passed context.
It is only for keep the context type up to date after e.g. `if` condition.

## Run next function before return

You can also run the next function before the return, so the next middlewares runs before the first middleware ends.

It can be usefull for measuring the time for response.

The last middleware that runs is the `resolve` function. It always runs as a last middleware.

```ts copy
const measuredResolver = resolver.use(({ ctx, next }) => {
  if (!ctx.user) throw new Error('Must be logged in!');

  const timeStart = performance.now();

  const resolverResult = next({
    ...ctx,
    user: ctx.user,
  });

  const time = performance.now() - timeStart;

  console.log('Time to resolve: ', time);
  console.log('The result of resolver is: ', resolverResult);

  return resolverResult;
});
```

As you can see, you still have to return the resolver result, it is for context type inferring and for passing the result up to middlewares that runs before, as you can nest multiple middlewares and the result returns recursively.

The type of middleware response is

```ts copy
type MiddlewareResponse<TContext extends Context> =
  | {
      ok: true;
      data: unknown;
      ctx: TContext;
    }
  | {
      ok: false;
      error: PtsqError;
      ctx: TContext;
    };
```

so you have to determine if the `ok` property is `true` or `false` to access the `data` or `error`.

## Arguments validation with middleware

You can validate part of arguments before middleware definition, so you can access the properties in the middleware.

```ts copy
const protectedResolver = resolver
  .args(
    Type.Object({
      firstName: Type.String(),
    }),
  )
  .use(
    ({
      ctx /* { user: User<any> | null } */,
      input /* { firstName: string } */,
      next,
    }) => {
      if (!ctx.user || ctx.user.firstName !== input.firstName)
        throw new Error('Must be logged in with firstName match!');

      return next({
        ...ctx,
        user: ctx.user,
      });
    },
  );
```

## Middleware pipes

If middlewares are piped, then all the middlewares run before the route call in piping order.

```ts copy
const protectedResolver = resolver.use(
  ({ ctx /* { user: User<any> | null } */, next }) => {
    if (!ctx.user) throw new Error('Must be logged in!');

    return next({
      ...ctx,
      user: ctx.user,
    });
  },
);

const adminResolver = protectedResolver.use(
  ({ ctx /* { user: User<any> } */, next }) => {
    if (ctx.user.role !== 'admin') throw new Error('Must be an admin!');

    return next({
      ...ctx,
      user: ctx.user,
    });
  },
);

const deleteOrganization = adminResolver.mutation({
  //...
  resolve: ({ ctx /* { user: User<'admin'> } */, input }) => {
    //...
  },
});
```

Piping the middleware with another middleware, pass the context returned from the first middleware as an input to the piped (next) middleware.

There is a demonstration of the `Middleware` types work.

```ts
// the mutation without any middleware
Mutation<{ user?: User | null }>;

// the first middleware gets the root context and checks if the user is undefined
Middleware<{ user?: User | null }, { user: User | null }>;

// the piped middleware gets the result context of the first middleware and checks if the user is null
Middleware<{ user: User | null }, { user: User }>;

// the mutation with a resolver that uses the piped middleware
Mutation<{ user: User }>;
```

## Standalone middleware

Standalone middleware allows you to create a middleware that is out of the server.

```ts filename="middleware/isAuthed.ts" copy
import { middleware } from '@ptsq/server';

export const isAuthed = middelware<{
  ctx: {
    user?: User;
  };
}>(({ ctx /* { user?: User | undefined } */, next }) => {
  if (!ctx.user) throw new PtsqError({ code: 'UNAUTHORIZED' });

  return next({
    user: ctx.user,
  });
});
```

As you can see we can define which context is required for the standalone middleware, then we can you the middleware as any other middleware.

```ts filename="ptsq.ts" copy
const createContext = async ({ req }: { req: Request }) => {
  const user = await getUserFromJWT(req);

  return {
    user,
  };
};

export const { resolver, router, serve } = PtsqServer.init({
  ctx: createContext,
});
```

```ts filename="resolvers/isAuthed.ts"
export const isAuthedResolver = resolver.use(isAuthed);
```

You can also define which input the standalone middleware requires

```ts copy
import { middleware } from '@ptsq/server';

export const hasPermission = middelware<{
  ctx: {
    user: User;
  };
  input: {
    roomId: string;
  };
}>(({ input /* { roomId: string } */, ctx /* { user: User } */, next }) => {
  if (!ctx.hasRoomPermissions(input.roomId, ctx.user))
    throw new PtsqError({ code: 'UNAUTHORIZED' });

  return next();
});
```

## Server middlewares

You can add middleware to the resolver, which calls them when the query or mutation created by that resolver will be called.

What if you want to run middleware no matter if the route is found or the resolver type (query or mutation) is correctly set?

```ts
export const { resolver, router, serve } = PtsqServer.init()
  .use(async ({ next, meta }) => {
    console.log('request: ', meta);

    const response = await next();

    console.log('response: ', response);

    return response;
  })
  .create();
```

The middleware that the server uses in the example will be called on every request, no matter if the route was found and the resolver type was correctly set.

It is very good for logging and something like that.
