## Links

Links are something like middleware but on the client side.

The last link is the terminating link.

The terminating link is responsible for sending the HTTP request and receiving the server's response.

```ts copy
import { createProxyClient } from '@ptsq/client';
import { BaseRouter } from './server';

const client = createProxyClient<BaseRouter>({
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/ptsq',
  links: [
    new PtsqLink(async ({ forward, meta }) => {
      console.log('Request data: ', meta);

      const response = await forward();

      console.log('Response data: ', response);

      return response;
    }),
  ],
});
```
