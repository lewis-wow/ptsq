# Error response

Since the error response is also transferred using JSON format between the server and the client, it must be transformed again on the client into a class representing the PTSQ error response.
When using clients working with Tanstack query, the error response type is automatically set to `PtsqClientError`.
Because Tanstack query does not use Promise objects to return results from the server, there is no need to further redefine the error response type.

However, by using a traditional client that returns the response in a Promise object, the error response must be rewritten because neither Promise nor the async/await constructs support defining error types.
The rewriting occurs when the exception itself is checked.
TypeScript allows you to define a predicate for a function that returns a boolean.
The predicate is the type of function parameter that is set if the function returns `true`.

```ts filename="Error check"
// async/await
try {
  const response = await client.user.list.query(...);
} catch(error) {
  if(PtsqClientError.isPtsqClientError(error)) {
    console.error(error.code);
  }
}

// Promise
client.user.list.query(...).then(...).catch((error) => {
  if(PtsqClientError.isPtsqClientError(error)) {
    console.error(error.code);
  }
});
```

Inside the `PtsqClientError.isPtsqClientError(error)` condition, the exception type is mapped from the `unknown` type to the `PtsqClientError` type and thus it is possible to safely access the PTSQ properties of the error response.
