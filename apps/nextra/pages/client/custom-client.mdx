# Custom client adapter

In addition to the provided React and Svelte client adapters, `ptsq` offers the flexibility to create custom client adapters tailored to specific use cases or frameworks.

By creating a custom client adapter, you can seamlessly integrate `ptsq` with any frontend framework or library of your choice. Whether you're working with Angular, Vue.js, or another frontend technology, a custom client adapter allows you to leverage the power and flexibility of `ptsq` within your preferred development environment.

Custom client adapters enable you to define how `ptsq` interacts with your frontend application, including data fetching, state management, and UI updates. This level of customization ensures that `ptsq` seamlessly integrates with your frontend architecture, providing a smooth and efficient developer experience.

Whether you're building a complex web application or a lightweight mobile app, custom client adapters empower you to leverage the full potential of `ptsq` while adhering to the specific requirements and conventions of your frontend stack.

## Defining query and mutation types

```ts copy filename="query.ts"
export type Query<
  _TDescription extends string | undefined,
  TDefinition extends {
    args?: any;
    output: any;
  },
> = {
  query: (requestInput: TDefinition['args']) => Promise<TDefinition['output']>;
};
```

```ts copy filename="mutation.ts"
import type { RequestOptions } from './createProxyClient';

export type Mutation<
  _TDescription extends string | undefined,
  TDefinition extends {
    args?: any;
    output: any;
  },
> = {
  mutate: (requestInput: TDefinition['args']) => Promise<TDefinition['output']>;
};
```

### Conditional methods

Imagine we want to show like `infiniteQuery` only if server accepts `cursor` property.

```ts copy filename="query.ts"
export type Query<
  _TDescription extends string | undefined,
  TDefinition extends {
    args?: any;
    output: any;
  },
> = {
  query: (requestInput: TDefinition['args']) => Promise<TDefinition['output']>;
} & (TDefinition['args'] extends { pageParam: any }
  ? {
      infiniteQuery: (
        requestInput: Omit<TDefinition['args'], 'pageParam'>,
      ) => Promise<TDefinition['output']>;
    }
  : {});
```

## Client type

Client type is for casting the result runtime Proxy-based client to correct types.

```ts copy filename="types.ts"
import type {
  Route as ClientRoute,
  Router as ClientRouter,
} from '@ptsq/client';
import type {
  inferClientResolverArgs,
  inferClientResolverOutput,
} from '@ptsq/server';

export type Client<TRouter extends ClientRouter> = {
  [K in keyof TRouter['_def']['routes']]: TRouter['_def']['routes'][K] extends ClientRouter
    ? Client<TRouter['_def']['routes'][K]>
    : TRouter['_def']['routes'][K] extends ClientRoute<'query'>
      ? Query<
          TRouter['_def']['routes'][K]['_def']['description'],
          {
            args: inferClientResolverArgs<
              TRouter['_def']['routes'][K]['_def']['argsSchema']
            >;
            output: inferClientResolverOutput<
              TRouter['_def']['routes'][K]['_def']['outputSchema']
            >;
          }
        >
      : TRouter['_def']['routes'][K] extends ClientRoute<'mutation'>
        ? Mutation<
            TRouter['_def']['routes'][K]['_def']['description'],
            {
              args: inferClientResolverArgs<
                TRouter['_def']['routes'][K]['_def']['argsSchema']
              >;
              output: inferClientResolverOutput<
                TRouter['_def']['routes'][K]['_def']['outputSchema']
              >;
            }
          >
        : never;
};
```

This approach ensures that `@ptsq/server` is only required for development purposes, while `@ptsq/client` remains a production dependency.

## Client runtime

```ts copy filename="client.ts"
import {
  createProxyUntypedClient,
  httpFetch,
  UndefinedAction,
  type Router as ClientRouter,
  type CreateProxyClientArgs,
} from '@ptsq/client';
import type { Client } from './types';

export const createCustomClient = <TRouter extends ClientRouter>(
  options: CreateProxyClientArgs,
): ReactClientRouter<TRouter> =>
  createProxyUntypedClient<[any, any]>({
    route: [],
    fetch: ({ route, type, args }) => {
      switch (type) {
        case 'cachedQuery':
          return cached({
            queryKey: [...route],
            fetch: (context) =>
              httpFetch({
                ...options,
                body: {
                  route: route.join('.'),
                  type: 'query',
                  input: args[0],
                },
                signal: context.signal,
              }),
            ...args[1],
          });
        default:
          throw new UndefinedAction();
      }
    },
  }) as ReactClientRouter<TRouter>;
```

This simple client does not allow mutations, it's not very practical, it's for simplicity.

Of course, you can define as many methods as you want and create a runtime for them in the switch in `fetch` function in the `createProxyUntypedClient`.
