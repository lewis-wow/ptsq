# Request abort

The library allows you to abort an already running request using the standard AbortController interface.
A function call to a query or mutation allows you to attach an AbortSignal interface to the request, which is based on the AbortController.

```ts copy
const abortController = new AbortController();

const response = await client.user.list.query(..., { signal: abortController.signal });

// Aborts the request
abortController.abort();
```

Request interrupts are supported by both the base library client and clients working with frontend frameworks like React and Svelte.

On the server side, an HTTP request can be accessed inside the request context creation.
The standard request interface provides interrupt information, so the server can also respond to client interrupts, but this is not very common.
