# PTSQ client

In addition to creating a server, PTSQ also offers to create a client that queries the server.
The library itself offers three client modules: for JavaScript or TypeScript without frameworks, React, Svelte.
However, PTSQ allows you to create your own client for your own frontend framework, this requires some knowledge of TypeScript and the type system in particular.

All framework client adapters refer to the base client module `@ptsq/client`.
The client requires a type argument, whose type must be the root router from the server or the result of introspection.
Various type-level transformations are further performed over this type, making it possible to construct a type-safe client.
The client has type assumptions for endpoint definitions, arguments, outputs, and endpoint descriptions.

The client itself is a Proxy object wrapping a function.
The client has no run-level control of endpoints, inputs, or outputs; control exists only at the type level.
So it is still possible to query the wrong path, use the wrong endpoint method, or use the wrong input.
For this behavior, TypeScript type checking must be turned off, as it would not allow the application to compile.

Creating the client itself requires a single mandatory `url` property that specifies which PTSQ server the client should query.

```ts copy
// creating a client with a schema from the router from the server
import type { BaseRouter } from './server';

const client = createProxyClient<BaseRouter>({
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/ptsq',
});

// creating a client with a schema from the introspection
import { BaseRouter } from './schema.generated';

const client = createProxyClient<typeof BaseRouter>({
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/ptsq',
});
```

## Fetch property

Another optional client setting is the `fetch` property.
This allows us to replace the HTTP server request call with a custom call.
This is useful for setting various request properties such as HTTP headers.
The `fetch` property can also be used to create a client in a different environment than inside the browser.
Without using the `fetch` setting, the client can only be used in a browser environment or newer versions of Node.js, as it uses the `globalThis.fetch` feature.
When setting up a custom fetch function, the entire call to the HTTP server can be replaced with a fetch polyfill, making it possible to run the client from environments other than the browser, such as older versions of Node.js that did not support fetch.

```ts copy
const client = createProxyClient<BaseRouter>({
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/ptsq',
  fetch: async (input, init) => {
    const jwt = await cookie.get('token');

    return fetchPolyfill(input, {
      ...init,
      headers: {
        ...init.headers,
        Authorization: `Bearer ${jwt}`,
      },
    });
  },
});
```

When the request is called, the last key of the Proxy object is used to select whether the request is a query or a mutation, and the HTTP request is sent with the appropriate data to the PTSQ server.

```ts copy
// endpoint = user.list
const response = await client.user.list.query(...);

// endpoint = user.create
const response = await client.user.create.mutate(...);
```

The client evaluates that the last key of the Proxy object is `mutate`, i.e. that it is a mutation.
It sends an HTTP POST request to the PTSQ server with the request body setting the endpoint type as mutation.
If the last key was `query`, the client would evaluate that this is a query and send the request with the endpoint set as a query.
If the type is unknown when the action is evaluated, the client itself throws an exception.
For API security, the endpoint type must also be validated on the server side.
